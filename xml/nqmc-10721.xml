      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pressure ulcers typically result from prolonged periods of uninterrupted pressure on the skin, soft tissue, muscle, and bone (Institute for Healthcare Improvement [IHI], 2007; Russo, Steiner, &amp;amp; Spector, 2008; Bates-Jensen, 2001). Vulnerable patients include the elderly, stroke and diabetic patients, those with dementia, circulatory diseases, dehydration, and malnutrition; and people who use wheelchairs or are bedridden&amp;mdash;that is, any patient with impaired mobility or sensation (Hurd et al., 2010; Maclean, 2003; Bates-Jensen, 2001). Pressure ulcers interfere with the activities of daily living, predispose patients to osteomyelitis and septicemia, and are strongly associated with longer hospital stays and mortality (Bates-Jensen, 2001). &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pressure ulcers are high-volume and high-cost adverse events across the spectrum of health care settings from acute hospitals to home health (Hurd et al., 2010; Russo, Steiner, &amp;amp; Spector, 2008; Bates-Jensen, 2001). The prevalence of pressure ulcers in health care facilities is increasing, with some 2.5 million patients being treated annually for pressure ulcers in acute care facilities (Russo, Steiner, &amp;amp; Spector, 2008; IHI, 2007). In 2006, there were 503,300 acute hospital stays during which pressure ulcers were noted&amp;mdash;a 78.9% increase from 1993 when there were about 281,300 hospital stays related to pressure ulcers (Russo, Steiner, &amp;amp; Spector, 2008; Maclean, 2003). &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pressure ulcer incidence rates vary considerably by clinical setting&amp;mdash;ranging from 0.4% to 38% in acute care, from 2.2% to 23.9% in skilled nursing facilities and nursing homes, and from 0% to 17% in home care (Duncan, 2007; IHI, 2007). &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Patients with acute care hospitalizations related to pressure ulcers were more likely to be discharged to long-term care facilities (e.g., a skilled nursing facility, an intermediate care facility, or a nursing home), than hospitalizations for all other conditions (Hurd et al., 2010; IHI, 2007). In fact, more than half of principal pressure ulcer stays (53.4%) and secondary pressure ulcer stays (54.5%) were discharged to long-term care&amp;mdash;more than 3 times the rate of hospitalizations for all other conditions (16.2%) (Hurd et al., 2010). Pressure ulcers are serious medical conditions and one of the most important measures of the quality of clinical care in nursing facilities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducts the National Nursing Home Survey, a continuing series of national sample surveys of nursing homes, their residents, and their staff. Data for the survey were obtained through personal interviews with facility administrators and designated staff who used administrative records to answer questions about the facilities, staff, services and programs, and medical records to answer questions about the residents. A total of 1,174 nursing home facilities participated in the latest National Nursing Home Survey (Park-Lee &amp;amp; Caffrey, 2009). &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As reported in the 2004 National Nursing Home Survey results, about 159,000 current U.S. nursing home residents (11%) had pressure ulcers. Stage 2 ulcers were the most common, accounting for about 50% of all pressure ulcers. Stages 1, 3, and 4 made up about the other 50% of all ulcers (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMS], 2007). Stage 1 pressure ulcers are not included in the proposed quality measure; researchers have suggested that inclusion of Stage 1 pressure ulcers in the quality measures adds little value (Brega et al., 2008; Lynn et al., 2007). &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2006, Abt Associates examined pressure ulcer incidence and prevalence across post-acute settings. For nursing homes, Minimum Data Set (MDS) 2.0 assessments were used for April 1, 2006, through July 15, 2006. The prevalence of pressure ulcers Stage 1 to 4 was 13%, with the prevalence of Stage 3 to 4 ulcers being 3% nationwide (Hurd et al., 2010). Pressure ulcers may cause extreme discomfort to the patient and often lead to serious, life-threatening infections, which substantially increase the total cost of care (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ], 2009; Russo, Steiner, &amp;amp; Spector, 2008; Cuddigan, Berlowitz, &amp;amp; Ayello, 2001). The main driver of cost is the presence of complications, which involve diagnostic tests, additional monitoring, more expensive pressure-relieving surfaces, and extended length of stays (AHRQ, 2009). &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As reported in the Federal Register, in 2006 there were 322,946 reported cases of Medicare patients with a pressure ulcer as a secondary diagnosis&amp;mdash;each case had an average charge of $40,381 for a hospital stay, for an annual total cost of $13 billion (CMS, 2007). The Advancing Excellence in America's Nursing Homes Campaign (n.d.), a national effort launched in 2006 to help nursing homes measurably to improve care, reported that it can cost as much as $19,000 to treat a single Stage 4 pressure ulcer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests racial disparities in quality of care in nursing homes between African Americans and Caucasians (Li et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2007; Miller et al., 2006; Grabowski, 2004; Mor et al., 2004; Howard et al., 2002) and between Hispanics and Caucasians (Fennell et al., 2010). Li et al. (2011) conducted an observation cohort study of pressure ulcer rates in 2.1 million white and 346,808 black residents in 12,473 nursing homes in the United States between 2003 and 2008. They reported a decrease in pressure ulcer rates, but noted that blacks still have higher rates than whites, and rates are higher for both blacks and whites in nursing facilities that have a higher proportion of black residents. Baumgarten et al. (2004) found that using multivariate analysis, controlling for eight resident characteristics and three facility characteristics, that race was significantly associated with pressure ulcer incidence and that patient characteristics mediated the higher risk. However, in 2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported in their key findings from the 2004 National Nursing Home Survey that there was no significant difference between white and nonwhite populations with respect to having pressure ulcers (Park-Lee &amp;amp; Caffrey, 2009). No research has been conducted on other types of disparities (e.g., ethnicity, rural/urban, or income) specifically for this measure. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To examine whether facilities with higher percentages of non-white residents have different performance scores for long-stay pressure ulcers (LS PUs), analyses were completed comparing the performance of facilities based on their percentage of non-white residents. Facilities were sorted based on their proportions of white residents that were greater than the median proportion of white residents. Black residents represented the highest mean (10.5%). The overall facility level mean was 7.7%, and 8.8% for those facilities with greater than 87 percent white residents. The mean for facilities increased as the proportion of non-White residents decreased. A median test was performed that cross tabulated racial composition (above/below median) with quality measure (QM) score (above/below median) and a 2-way chi-squared test for statistical dependence was run. The results were significant (chi-squared (1) = 405.77, p= less than .0001) indicating that that there is a statistically significant relationship between racial composition and QM score. A Mann-Whitney U test shows that prevalence of long stay pressure ulcers is lower for facilities with a greater proportion of white residents (z=-23.484, p= less than .0001). &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Socioeconomic Status&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;RTI analyses of the distribution of facility scores on this measure by Medicaid eligibility indicate that facilities with different proportions of Medicaid-eligible populations do have different performance scores on this measure, suggesting a relationship between socioeconomic status and prevalence of pressure ulcers among high risk long-stay residents. Analyses at the facility level examined differences in the NQF #0679 compared across two groups: facilities with proportions of Medicaid-eligible residents that were greater than or equal to the median proportion (75.0%), and facilities with fewer Medicaid-eligible residents than the median. Analyses showed that facilities with the higher proportion of Medicaid eligible residents had slightly higher rates of pressure ulcers (7.9% versus 6.5%). The developer cross-tabulated Medicaid eligibility rates (above/below median) with QM score (above/below median) and ran a 2-way chi-squared test for statistical dependence (with one degree of freedom). The results showed that there were statistically significant relationships between proportion of Medicaid eligible residents and facility QM score (p-value less than 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

This process allowed the final national testing of Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 to include well-developed and tested items.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The national validation and evaluation of the MDS 3.0 included 71 community nursing homes (NHs) (3,822 residents) and 19 VHA NHs (764 residents), regionally distributed throughout the United States. The evaluation was designed to test and analyze inter-rater agreement (reliability) between gold-standard (research) nurses and between facility and gold-standard nurses, validity of key sections, response rates for interview items, anonymous feedback on changes from participating nurses, and time to complete the MDS assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the test results showed that MDS 3.0 items had either excellent or very good reliability even when comparing research nurse to facility-nurse assessment. In most instances these were higher than those seen in the past with MDS 2.0. In addition, for the cognitive, mood and behavior items, national testing included collection of independent criterion or gold-standard measures. These MDS 3.0 sections were more highly matched to criterion measures than were MDS 2.0 items.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Improvements incorporated in MDS 3.0 produced a more efficient assessment: better quality information was obtained in less time. Such gains should improve identification of resident needs and enhance resident-focused care planning. In addition, including items recognized in other care settings is likely to enhance communication among providers. These significant gains reflect the cumulative effect of changes across the tool, including use of more valid items, direct inclusion of resident reports, improved clarity of retained items, deletion of poorly performing items, form redesign, and briefer assessment periods for clinical items.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to &lt;em&gt;Development &amp;amp; Validation of a Revised Nursing Home Assessment Tool: MDS 3.0.&lt;/em&gt; for additional information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
