      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the past fifteen years, there has been a growing recognition among health care professionals that domestic violence (DV), also known as intimate partner violence (IPV) is a highly prevalent public&#xD;&#xA;health problem with devastating effects on individuals, families and communities. Most Americans are seen at some point by a health care provider, and the health care setting offers a critical opportunity for early identification and even the primary prevention of abuse. Studies show that assessing for IPV in medical settings has been effective in identifying women who are victims and that patients are not offended when asked about current or past IPV. A host of professional health care associations have issued position statements to their members describing the impact of IPV on patients and suggesting strategies for assessment and identification of abuse. These statements represent important steps in raising awareness about IPV in health care settings. Generally, however, they offer neither specific guidelines for intervening and responding, nor criteria that promote the utilization and evaluation of recommended practice. The Family Violence Prevention Fund's (FVPF) domestic violence guideline offers specific recommendations for assessing for and responding to IPV that may be applied to multiple health settings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is one of 8 implementation measures that may be used to assess compliance with the clinical recommendations outlined in the FVPF guideline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a health problem of enormous proportions. It is estimated that between 20 and 30% of women and 7.5% of men in the United States have been physically and/or sexually abused by an intimate partner at some point in their adult lives. Heterosexual women are five to eight times more likely than heterosexual men to be victimized by an intimate partner. From 1993 to 1998, victimization by an intimate partner accounted for 22% of the violent crime experienced by females and 3% of the violent crime sustained by males. Women aged 16 to 24 experience the highest per capita rate of IPV.  For adolescents, the rates of experiencing some form of dating violence vary from 25 to 60%. While studies indicate that boys and girls may accept physical and sexual aggression as normative in dating and&#xD;&#xA;intimate partner relationships, adolescent females are more likely to receive significant physical injuries than boys and are more likely to be sexually victimized by their partners.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The National Center on Elder Abuse estimates that 818,000 elderly Americans were victims of domestic abuse in 1994. There are far&#xD;&#xA;fewer data on lesbian, gay, transgender, and bisexual (LGTB) victimization. However, the available literature suggests similarly high rates for LGTB adolescent and adult populations with higher rates in male same-sex relationships than female. IPV occurs in every urban, suburban, rural and remote community; in all social classes, and in all ethnic and religious groups including immigrant and refugee populations.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The estimates of children exposed to IPV vary from 3.3 million to ten million per year, depending on the specific definition of witnessing violence, the source of interview, and the age of child included in the survey. In the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study, conducted on a large sample of members (30,000 adults) of the Kaiser Health Plan in California, 12.5% of respondents indicated childhood exposure to IPV and 10.8% indicated a personal history of child abuse including physical, sexual and emotional abuse. This research and other studies indicate that children who witness IPV are seen with both frequency and regularity in the health care system as children and as adults.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In addition to injuries sustained by women during violent episodes, physical and psychological abuse are linked to a number of adverse medical health effects including arthritis, chronic neck or back pain, migraine or other types of headache, sexually transmitted infections (including human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]/acquired immune deficiency syndrome [AIDS]), chronic pelvic pain, peptic ulcers, chronic irritable bowel syndrome, and frequent indigestion, diarrhea, or constipation. Six percent of all pregnant women are battered and pregnancy complications, including low weight gain, anemia, infections, and first and second trimester bleeding, are significantly higher for abused women, as are maternal rates of depression, suicide attempts, and substance abuse.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Optimal management of other chronic illnesses such as asthma, HIV/AIDS, seizures, diabetes, gastrointestinal disorders, and hypertension can be problematic in women who are being abused or have been abused in the past. Often times the perpetrator controls the victim's access to and compliance with health protocols. Emerging research shows that women who are abused are less likely to engage in important preventive health care behaviors such as regular mammography and are more likely to participate in injurious health behaviors including smoking, alcohol abuse, and substance abuse. In many controlled studies, intimate partner violence (IPV) significantly increases the risk for serious mental health consequences for victims including depression, traumatic and posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. The health consequences of abuse can continue for years after the abuse has ended. IPV can also result in homicide; in 1996, 1,800 murders were attributed to intimates.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Adolescents also suffer devastating and often lifelong effects from dating violence. In one study, female adolescents who reported experiencing sexual or physical dating violence were 2.5 times as likely to report smoking, 8.6 times more likely to attempt suicide, and 3.4 times more likely to use cocaine than their non-abused peers. In addition, abused teens were 3.7 times more likely to use unhealthy weight control behaviors such as using laxatives or vomiting. The experience of interpersonal violence is also correlated with&#xD;&#xA;repeated pregnancy and higher rates of miscarriage among low-income adolescents.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;More than 100 studies have explored the short and long-term effects of IPV on children. In 30 to 60% of families affected by IPV, children are also directly abused. Children exposed to IPV, particularly chronic abuse, often show symptoms associated with posttraumatic stress disorder. One study found that a child’s exposure to IPV (without being directly assaulted) was sufficiently traumatic to precipitate moderate to severe symptoms of posttraumatic stress in 85% of the children surveyed. Although physical health problems have seldom been measured in children exposed to IPV, one study found that they are more likely to exhibit physical health problems including chronic somatic complaints, and behavioral problems such as depression, anxiety, and violence towards peers. Another study found that children exposed were also more likely to attempt suicide, abuse drugs and alcohol, run away from home, engage in teenage prostitution, and commit sexual assault crimes. There is a growing body of research regarding the impact of violence on early brain development that could have implications for children growing up in violent homes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is an urgent need to address family violence over the lifespan because health effects of victimization often persist for years after the abuse has ended. Adults who were abused as children, witnessed intimate partner violence, had a parent with a mental illness, or parental substance abuse are at significantly high risk for obesity, heart disease, hepatitis, diabetes, depression, and suicide. These adverse childhood experiences frequently cluster in households and have a cumulative effect--the more adverse exposures in a household, the higher the likelihood of long-term health problems as an adult.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;" />
