      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prevalence among Children&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;According to the 2011-2012 National Survey on Children's Health (NSCH), nearly one quarter of U.S. children (22.6%) saw a specialist in the previous year (Child and Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative [CAHMI], &quot;Indicator 4.12a,&quot; n.d.). The 2003 NSCH included questions on need to see a specialist, in which the results were comparable: 18.3% of children 0 to 5 years were reported to have needed specialty care; the figures for older children were 18.9% of those 6 to 11 years, and 22.4% of those 12 to 17 years (CAHMI, &quot;Specialists,&quot; n.d.).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Performance Gaps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;A primary shortcoming regarding children's access to specialty care is the type of insurance they have, specifically whether they have private insurance or either of the two main forms of public insurance &amp;ndash; Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The 2011-2012 NSCH reported that 19% of children with Medicaid/CHIP coverage received specialty care in the prior year, compared with 26% of privately insured children; 8% of Medicaid/CHIP-covered children had problems accessing specialty care, compared with 5% of privately insured children (CAHMI, &quot;Indicator 4.12a,&quot; n.d.). A 2010 study in Illinois found that callers posing as parents of children enrolled in Medicaid/CHIP were denied specialty appointments six times more often than parents of privately insured children (Bisgaier &amp;amp; Rhodes, 2011). A 2010 national survey conducted by the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that specialists participated in Medicaid/CHIP less frequently than primary care providers (71% vs 83%). Moreover, among specialists who participated in Medicaid/CHIP, 84% accepted all privately insured children while only 51% accepted all Medicaid/CHIP-enrolled children. These findings were mirrored in responses by primary care providers: 34% reported having &quot;great difficulty&quot; referring Medicaid/CHIP-enrolled children for specialty care compared with only 1% for privately insured children (GAO, 2011). &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A related challenge is that even specialists who accept Medicaid patients may not be open to new patients, or may not participate in a child's specific Medicaid health plan or program. A 2014 report from the Office of the Inspector General (2014) explored this issue among a sample of specialists who were listed as participating in a Medicaid health plan, and found that only 43% would offer an appointment to a new Medicaid patient. Not participating in the health plan, despite being listed, was the major contributor to not offering an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Severity and Burden of Condition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Lack of specialist availability can affect children in at least three ways. The most severe outcome would be that children would not see a specialist at all and would go without needed care. In the event they do obtain an appointment with a specialist, it may require a longer wait period than is appropriate for their condition, delaying their care. The specialist may also be located much further away than is optimal, forcing longer travel times. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These obstacles are a greater burden for families with fewer financial resources, as they may not have reliable transportation or be able to take time off work when appointments are available. Challenges are likely to be exacerbated for families who face language or cultural barriers with their health care providers (Jewett, Anderson, &amp;amp; Gilchrist, 2005).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to the original measure documentation for additional evidence supporting the measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
