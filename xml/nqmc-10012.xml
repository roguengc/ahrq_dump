      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the previous 10 to 15 years, significant advancements in multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) technology have contributed to a substantial increase in the diagnostic applications and accuracy of computed tomography (CT) imaging studies. Correspondingly, CT imaging can figure prominently in characterizing and facilitating treatment of a myriad of neurologic and oncologic-based childhood diseases. However, a major disadvantage of MDCT is the use of ionizing radiation and the prospect of increased risk for latent malignancies. Children who have multiple CTs in early childhood tend to be at greater risk for developing leukemia and related malignancies (Pearce et al., 2012). Although the available evidence on the risks of low-dose radiation still remains a matter of discussion, it is generally believed that there is a &quot;linear-no threshold&quot; risk relationship (Nievelstein, van Dam, &amp;amp; van der Molen, 2010). In other words, no dose of radiation is safe. Consequently, there is an overwhelming need to consider that any radiation used in the course of imaging has the capacity to cause secondary cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Within this context, reducing the medical radiation dose and exposure to children as much as possible by performing imaging studies with radiation doses &quot;as low as reasonably achievable&quot; (that is, ALARA) continues to gain attention and prominence for pediatric imaging best practice (American College of Radiology [ACR], 2009). In particular, professional practice and patient advocacy groups, as well as international scientific organizations, have focused on MDCT radiation dose reduction and optimization strategies. These groups include the ACR, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). The ACR accredits facilities for different imaging modalities, CT being one of them. As part of achieving ACR accreditation, facilities should have a policy and imaging protocols in place stating that radiation exposure to patients will be as low as reasonably achievable and therefore is consistent with ALARA principles (ACR, 2014).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An even higher level of care is specified by the Image Gently campaign, in which facilities are accredited by the ACR in pediatric CT imaging and commit to imaging pediatric patients with appropriate radiation dose. Having ALARA policies with age and/or size-specific radiation doses programmed into CT scanners is the essential first step for following this best practice. Although imaging guidelines have been developed, published, and advocated by numerous professional organizations, many hospitals and imaging entities still do not apply ALARA-based dose reduction techniques for all varieties of pediatric imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Considering that malignancy is the second leading cause of death in children in the United States, ALARA policies should be incorporated as standard-of-care for all pediatric imaging that makes use of ionizing radiation. This measure will reveal the percentage of facilities that have implemented ALARA policies for pediatric imaging, as well as the percentage that have gone the extra step to support the Image Gently campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Baseline Considerations for &quot;As Low as Reasonably Achievable&quot; (ALARA): Prevalence and Incidence of Malignancy in Children&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;ALARA and its related application to pediatric imaging policies require an assessment of the prevalence and incidence of malignancy in the pediatric population. A review of the literature reveals that childhood malignancies have been increasing slightly for the past few decades and comprise less than 1% of all malignancies diagnosed each year (American Cancer Society [ACS], 2014). For 2014, this correlates to nearly 10,450 children in the United States under the age of 15 years receiving a diagnosis of malignancy (ACS, 2014). Despite a malignancy rate of less than 1%, such cancers are the second leading cause of death in children in the United States (after injuries) (ACS, 2014). The ACS has estimated that approximately 1,350 children younger than 15 years old are expected to die from malignancy in 2014 (ACS, 2014). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To date, there is no definitive study or literature that reveals, in an absolute sense, the additional malignancy burden created by ionizing radiation used in the course of imaging children. However, it is widely understood that any reduction in radiation dose is beneficial and reduces harm to children (Lin, 2010). In a recent study from 2009, it was estimated that compared with a patient aged 40 years, the risk of cancer from a radiation imaging test is doubled for a patient aged 20 years and 50% lower for a patient aged 60 years (Smith-Bindman et al., 2009). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overuse of Radiation Exposure in Imaging Related to Lack of ALARA Policies: Radiation Dose Pathology and Severity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;Use of ionizing radiation-based imaging has increased substantially in recent years. The use of computed tomography (CT) on older children nearly tripled from 1996 to 2005 to a peak of 27 CT scans per 1,000 children (Miglioretti et al., 2013). Radiation dose associated with CT imaging introduces the possibility of chronic health risks related to malignancies sustained from radiation effects (American College of Radiology [ACR], 2009). CT-based radiation dose for pediatric patients is problematic because the developing cellular structures and tissues of children are significantly more radiosensitive than those of adults; children, therefore, will be at substantially elevated risk for malignancy (Hayes et al., 2012). Radiosensitive organs including the brain, bone marrow, lens of the eye, and thyroid gland can be exposed to radiation during CT of the head (Papadakis et al., 2011). In children under 5 years of age, about 20% of the active bone marrow is in the cranium, compared with 8% in adults (Christy, 1981). Children who have multiple CT scans in early childhood tend to be at greater risk for developing leukemia (Pearce et al., 2012). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While radiation reduction strategies are important, the emphasis should continue to be on avoiding unnecessary imaging altogether for maximal mitigation of harm. Some studies suggest that as many as a third of pediatric CT scans are unnecessary and that eliminating them could potentially reduce the number of CT-attributable cancers by a third (Miglioretti et al., 2013). Combining the two strategies &amp;mdash; reducing the highest 25% of doses and reducing unnecessary scans &amp;mdash; could potentially prevent 62% of the projected radiation-related cancers (Miglioretti et al., 2013).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See the original measure documentation for additional evidence supporting the measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

The face validity of this measure was established by a national panel of experts and parent representatives for families of children with headaches and seizures convened by the Quality Measurement, Evaluation, Testing, Review, and Implementation Consortium (Q-METRIC). The Q-METRIC panel included nationally recognized experts in the area of imaging children, representing general pediatrics, pediatric radiology, pediatric neurology, pediatric neurosurgery, pediatric emergency medicine, general emergency medicine, and family medicine. In addition, face validity of this measure was considered by experts in state Medicaid program operations, health plan quality measurement, health informatics, and health care quality measurement. In total, the Q-METRIC imaging panel included 15 experts, providing a comprehensive perspective on imaging children and the measurement of quality metrics for states and health plans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Q-METRIC expert panel concluded that this measure has a high degree of face validity through a detailed review of concepts and metrics considered to be essential to the appropriate imaging of children. Concepts and draft measures were rated by this group for their relative importance. This measure was very highly rated, receiving an average score of 9.0 (with 9 as the highest possible score).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data and Methods&lt;/em&gt;. This measure was tested using an in-person telephone survey of staff members at facilities in Michigan indicating that they provide computed tomography (CT) services to children. Indication of pediatric CT service capabilities was confirmed with state Certificate of Need (CoN) reports; &quot;as low as reasonably achievable&quot; (ALARA) protocol responses were validated through accreditation information published by the American College of Radiology (ACR).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We obtained the statewide universe of CT imaging facilities from the Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH) Certificate of Need Annual Survey Report for CT Services Provided by Hospitals, Freestanding Facilities, and Host Sites (MDCH, 2012). Facilities eligible to be surveyed were restricted to those that reported at least one pediatric head or body scan for children less than 18 years old (refer to Appendix A of the original measure documentation) (Note, at the time of measure testing, the 2012 annual survey was the most current report available). CoN programs are designed to ensure that health facilities, services, and equipment match the needs of the population. In Michigan, facilities with CT scanners submit survey data in order to document sufficient utilization of the service to justify the location. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The telephone survey was conducted among a convenience sample of facilities to determine if information could feasibly and accurately be obtained from facility staff. Respondents consisted of lead CT technologists or medical directors at each facility; the brief telephone survey asked whether their facility performed CT scans on pediatric patients younger than 18 years old. Those responding 'yes' to this question were then asked: &quot;Does your facility have a written policy to implement ALARA principles or specific protocols to reduce radiation exposure for CT imaging of children?&quot; This question was followed by a brief set of questions to determine the number of different protocols to reduce radiation exposure during CT imaging in use at the facility for three body regions (head, chest, abdomen/pelvis).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We employed a convenience sample of 65 facilities providing CT imaging, of which 40 facilities were affiliated with other sites within a larger health care organization. From this sample, we obtained completed surveys from 21 individual sites representing a total of 58 (30%) of the 194 facilities reported to conduct CT scans of children in Michigan. Among the surveyed staff at these facilities, 100% reported the presence of policies to implement ALARA specific to children who undergo a CT scan. Seven staff members provided answers to questions regarding the number of protocols, two of whom responded they were unsure. The range of the number of protocols by body region was 2 to 12 among respondents who provided a number.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Validity of Survey Data&lt;/em&gt;. Telephone survey responses were validated using data acquired from the ACR Accreditation Web site (2014).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of the 194 Michigan facilities that performed CT scans of children in 2012, 49% were ACR accredited in 2014 for CT imaging, indicating that they had policies for ALARA. Additionally, 39% of the facilities were noted to support Image Gently, indicating a commitment to imaging pediatric patients with an appropriate radiation dose (Table 2 of the original measure documentation). It should be noted that all facilities (100%) supporting Image Gently were also ACR accredited. Among the 58 facilities that reported ALARA policy compliance via the telephone survey, 33 (57%) were verified as having ACR accreditation (which includes having an ALARA policy).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
