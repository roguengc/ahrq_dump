      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This measure is used to assess the risk-adjusted standardized transfusion ratio (STrR) for dialysis facility patients. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The STrR is defined to be the ratio of the number of eligible red blood cell transfusion events observed in patients dialyzing at a facility, to the number of eligible transfusion events that would be expected under a national norm, after accounting for the patient characteristics within each facility. Eligible transfusions are those that do not have any claims pertaining to the comorbidities identified for exclusion, in the one year look back period prior to each observation window. This measure is calculated as a ratio, but can also be expressed as a rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several changes in the end stage renal disease (ESRD) system are likely to impact anemia management. These include identification of safety concerns associated with aggressive erythropoiesis‐stimulating agent (ESA) use, expansion of the ESRD Prospective Payment System bundled payment, and the development of the ESRD Quality Incentive Program. There are concerns that these changes could result in underutilization of ESAs, with lower achieved hemoglobin values that may increase the frequency of red blood cell transfusion in the United States (U.S.) chronic dialysis population.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Blood transfusion may be an indicator for underutilization of treatments to increase endogenous red blood cell production (e.g., ESA, iron). In addition, dialysis patients who are eligible for kidney transplant and are transfused risk the development of becoming sensitized to the donor pool thereby making transplant more difficult to accomplish. Blood transfusions carry a small risk of transmitting blood borne infections, development of a transfusion reaction, and using infusion centers or hospitals to transfuse patients is expensive, inconvenient, and could compromise future vascular access. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Monitoring the risk‐adjusted transfusion rate at the dialysis facility level, relative to a national standard, allows for detection of treatment patterns in dialysis‐related anemia management. This is of particular importance due to recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance regarding minimizing the use of ESAs and new economic incentives to minimize ESA use introduced by Medicare bundling payment for ESAs. As providers use less ESAs in an effort to minimize the risks associated with aggressive anemia treatment it becomes more important to monitor for an overreliance on transfusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

If the measure were a simple average across individuals in the facility, the usual approach for determining measure reliability would be a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), in which the between and within facility variation in the measure is determined. The inter-unit reliability (IUR) measures the proportion of the measure variability that is attributable to the between-facility variance. The STrR, however, is not a simple average and the developer instead estimates the IUR using a bootstrap approach, which uses a resampling scheme to estimate the within facility variation that cannot be directly estimated by ANOVA. A small IUR (near 0) reveals that most of the variation of the measures between facilities is driven by random noise, indicating the measure would not be a good characterization of the differences among facilities, whereas a large IUR (near 1) indicates that most of the variation between facilities is due to the real difference between facilities. Our approach for calculating IUR is presented in the appendix. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Statistical Results from Reliability Testing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The STrR calculation only included facilities with at least 10 patient years at risk. Overall, the developer found that IURs for the one-year STrR have a range of 0.60-0.66 across the years 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, which indicates that around two-thirds of the variation in the one-year STrR can be attributed to the between-facility differences and one-third to within-facility variation. This value of IUR indicates a moderate degree of reliability. When stratified by facility size, we find that, as expected, larger facilities have greater IUR.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpretation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This value of IUR indicates a moderate degree of reliability. When stratified by facility size, the developer finds that, as expected, larger facilities have greater IUR.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Validity Testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Method of Validity Testing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Validity was assessed using Poisson regression models to measure the association between facility level the 2014 standardized mortality ratio (SMR, National Quality Forum [NQF] 0369) and 2014 standardized hospitalization ratio (SHR, NQF 1463) and tertiles of STrR. Facility-level STrR were divided into tertiles (T1 to T3) and the relative risk (RR) of mortality (and hospitalization, separately) was calculated for each tertile, using the T1 as the reference group. Thus, a RR greater than 1.0 would indicate a higher RR of mortality or hospitalization, compared to the highest performance tertile (T1) of STrR.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Validity was also assessed using a Poisson regression model to measure the association between facility level STrR and tertiles of % of patients with Hgb less than 10. Facility-level % of patients with hemoglobin (Hgb) less than 10 were divided into tertiles (T1 to T3) and RR of transfusions were calculated for each tertile, using the T1 as the reference group. Thus, a RR greater than 1.0 would indicate a higher RR of transfusion, compared to the highest performance tertile (T1) of % of patients with Hgb less than 10.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In May 2012, there was an assessment of the measure's face validity based on polling of a Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Technical Expert Panel (TEP).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Statistical Results from Validity Testing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Association of STrR with other facility-level outcomes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tertiles of STrR were defined as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;T1: 0 - less than 0.66 &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;T2: 0.66 - less than 1.15 &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;T3: 1.15 - less than 5.66 &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;*T1 as Reference&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Results from the Poisson model indicated that the STrR tertiles were significantly associated with both SMR and SHR.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the 2014 SMR, the RR of mortality increased as the STrR tertiles increased from the reference group (tertile 1). For tertile 2, RR=1.06 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.08; p less than 0.001), and for tertile 3, RR=1.14 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.16; p less than 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similarly for 2014 SHR, the RR of hospitalization increased as the STrR tertiles increased from the reference group (tertile 1) with the lowest risk in tertile 1. For tertile 2, RR=1.11 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.11; p less than 0.001), and for tertile 3, RR=1.29 (95% CI: 1.29, 1.30; p less than 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Association of STrR with facility-level intermediate anemia management outcome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tertiles of % of patients with Hgb less than 10 were defined as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;T1: 0 - less than 9.5% &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;T2: 9.5% - less than 16.5% &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;T3: 16.5% - less than 85.3% &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;*T1 as Reference&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Results from the Poisson model indicated that the % of patients with Hgb less than 10 was significantly associated with the risks of transfusion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The RR of transfusions increased as the tertiles of % of patients with Hgb less than 10 increased from the reference group (tertile 1). For tertile 2, RR=1.15 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.18; p less than 0.001), and for tertile 3, RR=1.31 (95% CI: 1.28, 1.33; p less than 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Results of TEP Vote Establishing Face Validity of Standardized Transfusion Ratio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Six out of six voting members of CMS's 2012 TEP voted to recommend development of a facility-level Standardized Transfusion Ratio measure. The consensus recommendation of that clinical expert panel included the recommendation to include risk adjustment for conditions that are associated with an increased risk of blood transfusion and in some cases, increased risk of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA)-associated adverse events, such as hereditary anemia, chronic bone marrow failure conditions and active cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpretation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The overall measure demonstrates face validity based on the structured 2012 TEP vote.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, testing of the measure supports construct validity. The positive correlation between this measure and SMR and SHR respectively indicates that facilities with more transfusions than would be expected based on national rates, also have higher standardized mortality and standardized hospitalization rates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the demonstrated association between STrR and other facility outcomes, the above results demonstrate the association between facility-level achieved Hgb, an intermediate outcome reflecting facility anemia management processes, and STrR. The results of dialysis facility achieved Hgbs, grouped into tertiles, demonstrates statistically significant differences across tertiles with reassuring stepwise increments of STrR between tertiles, suggesting &quot;dose effect.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

The sum of all such expectations over patients in a facility yields the overall expected number of transfusions for the facility given its specific patient mix. This measure is based on Medicare administrative claims and databases, and is applied to patients covered by Medicare.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;All transfusions associated with transplant hospitalization are excluded. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Patients are also excluded if they have a Medicare claim for: hemolytic and aplastic anemia, solid organ cancer (breast, prostate, lung, digestive tract and others), lymphoma, carcinoma in situ, coagulation disorders, multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome and myelofibrosis, leukemia, head and neck cancer, other cancers (connective tissue, skin, and others), metastatic cancer, and sickle cell anemia within one year of their patient time at risk. Since these comorbidities are associated with higher risk of transfusion and require different anemia management practices that the measure is not intended to address, every patient's risk window is modified to have at least 1 year free of claims that contain these exclusion eligible diagnoses. Refer to the original measure documentation for International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) or ICD, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes to identify these comorbidities. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

An event is defined as the transfer of one or more units of blood or blood products into a recipient's blood stream (code set is provided in the numerator details) among patients dialyzing at the facility during the inclusion episodes of the reporting period. Inclusion episodes are those that do not have any claims pertaining to the comorbidities identified for exclusion, in the one year look back period prior to each observation window.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Transfusion events in the inpatient setting are counted in the following way. The event is identified by the presence in a Medicare inpatient claim of the appropriate International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) procedure codes (99.03, 99.04), or, value code (37). For inpatient transfusion events that are identified using specific ICD-9 procedure codes (99.03, 99.04), the developer identifies a transfusion event for each transfusion procedure code with a corresponding unique date listed on the inpatient claim, thus allowing determination of multiple transfusion events on inpatient claims with multiple ICD-9 procedure codes present. For inpatient claims with value code (37), the developer counts a single transfusion event regardless of the number of transfusion value codes reported, so that the number of discrete events counted is the same whether the claim value code indicates 1 unit of blood or multiple units of blood. This results in a more conservative estimate of blood transfusion events from inpatient claims with transfusion value codes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Transfusion events are less common in the outpatient setting. Transfusion events in the outpatient setting are counted in the following way. Events derived from outpatient claims are identified by claims with Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes (P9010, P9011, P9016, P9021, P9022, P9038, P9039, P9040, P9051, P9054, P9056, P9058, 36430); or, value code (37). In outpatient claims, the developer counts a transfusion event for each HCPCS and corresponding unique revenue center date to determine the number of unique transfusion events. Therefore, multiple corresponding unique dates for revenue center codes will result in multiple transfusions events, while multiple HCPCS codes reported for the same revenue center date are counted as a single transfusion event, regardless of the number of units of blood recorded. Finally, outpatient claims with a transfusion related value code (37) is counted as one event.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to the original measure documentation for detailed procedures to determine unique transfusion events at the claim level.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Unspecified&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regression model used to compute a facility's &quot;expected&quot; number of transfusions for this measure contains many factors associated with frequency of hospitalization and thought to be associated with transfusion event rates. Specifically, the model adjusts for patient age, diabetes, duration of end stage renal disease (ESRD), nursing home status, body mass index (BMI) at incidence, individual comorbidities at incidence, reported on the Medical Evidence Form (CMS-2728), and calendar year. This model allows the baseline transfusion rates to vary between strata (facilities), but assumes that the regression coefficients are the same across all strata; this approach is robust to possible differences between facilities in the patient mix being treated. Refer to the original measure documentation for additional details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
