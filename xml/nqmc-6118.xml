      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) developed the acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 30-day readmission measure to complement the existing AMI process-of-care and mortality measures. Risk-standardized readmission rates (RSRRs) can provide important additional information about quality of care that is currently not captured by the process and mortality measures and is currently unavailable to hospitals. Variation in readmission, after adjusting for case mix, may reflect differences in hospitals' general environments (such as coordination of care, patient safety policies, and staffing) or variation in care processes not measured in the current core measure set. Outcome measures can focus attention on a broader set of healthcare activities that affect patients' well-being. Moreover, improving outcomes is the ultimate goal of quality improvement, and thus the inclusion of outcomes measures assists in attaining improvement goals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Readmission of patients who were recently discharged after hospitalization with AMI represents an important, expensive, adverse outcome. The risk of readmission can be modified by the quality and type of care provided to these patients. Improving readmission rates is the joint responsibility of hospitals and clinicians. Measuring readmission will create incentives to invest in interventions to improve hospital care, better assess the readiness of patients for discharge, and facilitate transitions to outpatient status. This measure is also responsive to the recent call by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) to develop readmission measures, with AMI highlighted as one of seven conditions that account for nearly 30% of potentially preventable readmissions in the 15-day window after initial hospital discharge (MedPAC, 2007).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

The RSRR is calculated as the ratio of the number of &quot;predicted&quot; to the number of &quot;expected&quot; readmissions, multiplied by the national unadjusted readmission rate. For each hospital, the &quot;numerator&quot; of the ratio is the number of readmissions within 30 days predicted on the basis of the hospital's performance with its observed case mix, and the &quot;denominator&quot; is the number of readmissions expected on the basis of the nation's performance with that hospital's case mix. This approach is analogous to a ratio of &quot;observed&quot; to &quot;expected&quot; used in other types of statistical analyses. It conceptually allows for a comparison of a particular hospital's performance given its case-mix to an average hospital's performance with the same case mix.

The expected number of readmissions (the denominator) is obtained by regressing the risk factors and a common intercept on the readmission outcome using all hospitals in our sample, multiplying the subsequent estimated regression coefficients by the patient characteristics observed in the hospital, transforming, and then summing over all patients in the hospital to get a value.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p class=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;To assess hospital performance in any reporting period, the model coefficients are re-estimated using the years of data in that period.

Readmission rates following discharge for AMI are high. For example, rates of all-cause readmission at 30 days have been found to range from 11.3% (Barbagelata et al., 2004) to 28.1% (Jonas et al., 1999).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Readmission rates are influenced by the quality of inpatient and outpatient care, the availability and use of effective disease management programs, and the bed capacity of the local health care system. Some of the variation in readmissions may be attributable to delivery system characteristics (Fisher et al., 1994). Also, interventions during and after a hospitalization can be effective in reducing readmission rates in geriatric populations generally (Benbassat and Taragin, 2000; Naylor et al., 1999; Coleman et al., 2006) and for AMI patients specifically (Carroll et al., 2007; Young et al., 2003; Bondestam et al., 1995; Ades et al., 1992). Moreover, such interventions can be cost saving (Coleman et al., 2006; Naylor et al., 1999; Ades et al., 1992). Tracking readmissions also emphasizes improvement in care transitions and care coordination. Although discharge planning is required by Medicare as a condition of participation for hospitals, transitional care focuses more broadly on &quot;hand-offs&quot; of care from one setting to another, and may have implications for quality and costs (Coleman, 2005).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) has called for hospital-specific public reporting of readmission rates, identifying AMI as one of seven conditions that account for nearly 30% of potentially preventable readmissions in the 15-day window after initial hospital discharge (MedPAC, 2007). MedPAC finds that readmissions are common, costly, and often preventable. Based on 2005 Medicare data, MedPAC estimates that about 13.4% of Medicare AMI admissions were followed by a potentially preventable readmission within 15 days, accounting for nearly 21,000 admissions at a cost of $136 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

The RSRR is calculated as the ratio of the number of &quot;predicted&quot; to the number of &quot;expected&quot; readmissions, multiplied by the national unadjusted readmission rate. For each hospital, the &quot;numerator&quot; of the ratio is the number of readmissions within 30 days predicted on the basis of the hospital's performance with its observed case mix, and the &quot;denominator&quot; is the number of readmissions expected on the basis of the nation's performance with that hospital's case mix. This approach is analogous to a ratio of &quot;observed&quot; to &quot;expected&quot; used in other types of statistical analyses. It conceptually allows for a comparison of a particular hospital's performance given its case-mix to an average hospital's performance with the same case mix. Thus a lower ratio indicates lower-than-expected readmission or better quality and a higher ratio indicates higher-than-expected readmission or worse quality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p class=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;The predicted hospital outcome (the numerator) is calculated by regressing the risk factors and the hospital-specific intercept on the risk of readmission, multiplying the estimated regression coefficients by the patient characteristics in the hospital, transforming, and then summing over all patients attributed to the hospital to get a value. The expected number of readmissions (the denominator) is obtained by regressing the risk factors and a common intercept on the readmission outcome using all hospitals in our sample, multiplying the subsequent estimated regression coefficients by the patient characteristics observed in the hospital, transforming, and then summing over all patients in the hospital to get a value.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p class=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;To assess hospital performance in any reporting period, the model coefficients are re-estimated using the years of data in that period.

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our approach to risk adjustment was tailored to and appropriate for a publicly reported outcome measure, as articulated in the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Statement, &quot;Standards for Statistical Models Used for Public Reporting of Health Outcomes&quot; (Krumholz et al., 2006).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The measure employs a hierarchical logistic regression model (a form of hierarchical generalized linear model [HGLM]) to create a hospital level 30-day risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR). This approach to modeling appropriately accounts for the structure of the data (patients clustered within hospitals), the underlying risk due to patients' comorbidities, and sample size at a given hospital when estimating hospital readmission rates. In brief, the approach simultaneously models two levels (patient and hospital) to account for the variance in patient outcomes within and between hospitals (Normand et al., 2007). At the patient level, each model adjusts the log-odds of readmission within 30-days of admission for age, sex, selected clinical covariates and a hospital-specific intercept. The second level models the hospital-specific intercepts as arising from a normal distribution. The hospital intercept, or hospital specific effect, represents the hospital contribution to the risk of readmission, after accounting for patient risk and sample size, and can be inferred as a measure of quality. The hospital-specific intercepts are given a distribution in order to account for the clustering (non-independence) of patients within the same hospital. If there were no differences among hospitals, then after adjusting for patient risk, the hospital intercepts should be identical across all hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to the original measure documentation for the final set of risk-adjustment variables included.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Candidate and Final Risk-adjustment Variables: Candidate variables were patient-level risk-adjustors that are expected to be predictive of readmission, based on empirical analysis, prior literature, and clinical judgment, including demographic factors (age, sex) and indicators of comorbidity and disease severity. For each patient, covariates were obtained from Medicare claims extending 12 months prior to and including the index admission. The model adjusted for case differences based on the clinical status of the patient at the time of admission. We used condition categories (CCs), which are clinically meaningful groupings of more than 15,000 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes. We did not risk-adjust for CCs that were possible adverse events of care and that were only recorded in the index admission. In addition, only comorbidities that conveyed information about the patient at that time or in the 12-months prior, and not complications that arose during the course of the hospitalization were included in the risk-adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The final set of risk-adjustment variables included:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; summary=&quot;Final Set of Risk-adjustment Variables&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;tbody&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot; scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;Demographic&lt;/th&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Age-65 (years above 65, continuous) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Male &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;/td&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot; scope=&quot;row&quot;&gt;Comorbidity&lt;/th&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Diabetes mellitus (DM) and DM complications &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Iron deficiency and other/unspecified anemias and blood disease &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Congestive heart failure &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Valvular and rheumatic heart disease &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;End-stage renal disease or dialysis &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Other urinary tract disorders &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Arrhythmias &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Pneumonia &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Renal failure &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Vascular or circulatory disease &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Disorders of fluid/electrolyte/acid-base &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Coronary atherosclerosis/other chronic ischemic heart disease &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;History of infection &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Cerebrovascular disease &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Metastatic cancer and acute leukemia &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Cancer &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Decubitus ulcer or chronic skin ulcer &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Dementia and senility &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Angina pectoris/old myocardial infarction &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Stroke &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Asthma &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Acute coronary syndrome &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Hemiplegia, paraplegia, paralysis, functional disability &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Protein-calorie malnutrition &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Anterior myocardial infarction &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Other location of myocardial infarction &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;History of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;History of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;/td&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/tbody&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/table&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Full details of the development of the risk-standardization model for this measure are available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.qualitynet.org&quot; title=&quot;QualityNet Web site&quot;&gt;www.qualitynet.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

The results were substantively similar to those for the 2006-2008 calendar year dataset (data not shown). &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We computed a summary statistic for assessing model performance: the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (c-statistic), which is an indicator of the model's discriminant ability or ability to correctly classify those who are and are not readmitted within 30 days (values range from 0.5 meaning no better than chance to 1.0 meaning perfect discrimination). The area under the ROC curve (c-statistic) remained constant at 0.63. For the model using the 2006-2008 calendar year dataset, the observed readmission rate was 8.3% among patients in the lowest predicted decile and 33.3% among patients in the highest predicted decile, a range of 25%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Examining the overall distribution of the risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) based on the 2006-2008 calendar year dataset, the 25th and 75th percentiles were 19.4% and 20.3%, respectively. The odds of all-cause readmission if treated at a hospital one standard deviation above the national average was 1.34 times higher than the odds of all-cause readmission if treated at a hospital one standard deviation below the national average. If there were no systematic differences between hospitals, the between-hospital variance would be zero and the odds ratio would be 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
