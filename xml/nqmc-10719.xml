      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research findings indicate that approximately 75% of nursing facility residents fall at least once a year; twice the rate of their counterparts in the community (Rubenstein, Josephson, &amp;amp; Robbins, 1994). Further, it is estimated that 10% to 25% of nursing facility resident falls result in fractures and/or hospitalization (Vu, Weintraub, &amp;amp; Rubenstein, 2004). Saliba and Buchanan (2008) tested the proposed Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 items, including those assessing the prevalence of any falls and falls with major injuries. Their study included 4,586 residents from 71 community nursing facilities and 19 Veteran's Administration nursing facilities in 8 different states and found rates of falls and falls with injury similar to those reported in the literature. During their six-month data collection period, they found that approximately 24% of patients reported at least one fall since the prior assessment. Among the 24% who experienced a fall, 9% had at least one fall with major injury and an additional 30% had at least one fall with minor injury (Saliba &amp;amp; Buchanan, 2008).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Monitoring the prevalence of injurious falls at the facility level is very important for protecting the health of nursing facility residents. Research has shown that falls resulting in serious injury, such as hip fracture, are a leading cause of death and disability in this population (Rubenstein, Josephson, &amp;amp; Robbins, 1994). The prevalence of injurious falls occurs for many reasons, many of which are preventable. Fonad and colleagues (2008) found significant correlations between fall risk and use of wheelchairs, safety belts, and bed rails, highlighting an area to refocus efforts for preventative measures. Moreover, studies show that such falls can leave up to 50% to 65% of residents with fears that affect both their functional abilities and social activities (Magaziner et al., 1997; Yardley &amp;amp; Smith, 2002). &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Falls also represent a significant cost burden to the entire health care system, with injurious falls accounting for 6% of medical expenses among those age 65 and older (Tinetti &amp;amp; Williams, 1998). Studies have shown that falls account for 10% of visits to the emergency department and 6% of urgent hospitalizations among elderly people (Tinetti, 2003). In addition, a 1993 review estimated the lifetime costs associated with fall-related injuries (direct, morbidity, and mortality) to be $12.6 billion, or approximately 6% of all medical care expenses for the elderly United States (U.S.) population (Runge, 1993). Among the skilled nursing facility population, the average 6-month cost of a patient with a hip fracture was estimated at $11,719 in 1996 U.S. dollars (Kramer et al., 1997). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Race&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Analyses of racial/ethnic disparities were conducted at both the resident and facility levels using Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 data from Quarter 2 (Q2) 2014. Resident level analyses used data for all long-stay residents (1,160,465 individuals), and facility level analyses were for the 13,751 facilities that met the required minimum number of residents for public reporting. The lowest rate of injurious falls was found among black residents (1.2%) and the highest rate was among white residents (3.5%). Differences in the rate of falls with major injury by racial/ethnic group were found to be statistically significant (p less than 0.0001). &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Analyses at the facility level examined differences in the percent of residents who experienced one or more falls with a major injury compared across two groups: facilities with proportions of white residents that were greater than or equal to the median proportion (88.4%) for facilities with sufficient denominator size to meet minimum requirements for public reporting, and facilities with fewer white residents than the median. Facilities whose residents population included a greater proportion of non-white residents had higher proportions of residents who had an injurious fall than did facilities serving a greater proportion of white residents. In an additional analysis, the developer cross-tabulated racial composition (above/below median) with quality measure (QM) score (above/below median) and ran a 2-way Chi-square test for statistical dependence (with one degree of freedom). The results showed that there were statistically significant relationships between racial composition and the QM score (P less than 0.001). These results appear to contradict finding of greater rates of falls among white residents, but may be understood as the distinction between resident level and facility level measures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Socioeconomic Status&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To examine the potential for a relationship between socioeconomic disparity and injurious falls, the developer examined the performance of this measure in facilities stratified by the proportion of residents who are Medicaid eligible. Medicaid eligibility is a proxy measure of low socioeconomic status. For this analysis, facilities were stratified into two groups: facilities with greater than 75% of residents who were Medicaid eligible and facilities with less than 75% of residents who were Medicaid eligible (75% of facilities have 75% or more of residents included in this measure who are Medicaid eligible). In Q2 of 2014, the mean score on this measure for facilities with a higher proportion of Medicaid eligible residents was 3.1%, versus 3.7% for facilities with a smaller proportion of Medicaid eligible residents. This is a significant difference between the two groups [F(1,13725) = 114.14, p = less than .0001). Thus, the relationship between socioeconomic status, as stratified by the proportion of residents who are Medicaid eligible, suggests that facilities with a higher proportion of low socioeconomic status residents have lower rates of falls with major injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A joint RAND/Harvard team engaged in a deliberate iterative process to incorporate provider and consumer input, expert consultation, scientific advances in clinical knowledge about screening and assessment, Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) experience, and intensive item development and testing by a national Veteran's Health Administration (VHA) consortium. This process allowed the final national testing of Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 to include well-developed and tested items.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The national validation and evaluation of the MDS 3.0 included 71 community nursing homes (NHs) (3,822 residents) and 19 VHA NHs (764 residents), regionally distributed throughout the United States. The evaluation was designed to test and analyze inter-rater agreement (reliability) between gold-standard (research) nurses and between facility and gold-standard nurses, validity of key sections, response rates for interview items, anonymous feedback on changes from participating nurses, and time to complete the MDS assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the test results showed that MDS 3.0 items had either excellent or very good reliability even when comparing research nurse to facility-nurse assessment. In most instances these were higher than those seen in the past with MDS 2.0. In addition, for the cognitive, mood and behavior items, national testing included collection of independent criterion or gold-standard measures. These MDS 3.0 sections were more highly matched to criterion measures than were MDS 2.0 items.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Improvements incorporated in MDS 3.0 produced a more efficient assessment: better quality information was obtained in less time. Such gains should improve identification of resident needs and enhance resident-focused care planning. In addition, including items recognized in other care settings is likely to enhance communication among providers. These significant gains reflect the cumulative effect of changes across the tool, including use of more valid items, direct inclusion of resident reports, improved clarity of retained items, deletion of poorly performing items, form redesign, and briefer assessment periods for clinical items.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to &lt;em&gt;Development &amp;amp; Validation of a Revised Nursing Home Assessment Tool: MDS 3.0.&lt;/em&gt; for additional information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
