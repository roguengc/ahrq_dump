      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012, total Medicare expenditures were $574.2 billion, representing 3.6% of gross domestic product (GDP) (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMS], 2014). Current estimates suggest that Medicare spending will increase to 5.6% of GDP by 2040 due to both an increase in the Medicare population as well as an increase in Medicare spending on each beneficiary (CMS, 2014). The growth in Medicare spending is unsustainable and highlights the need to create incentives for high-value care. A critical first step in moving toward high-value care is to define an approach to calculate costs that is transparent to consumers and fair to providers. This measure uses standardized payments to reflect differences in the management of care for patients with an elective primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) and/or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) both during hospitalization and after discharge. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Payments, however, are difficult to interpret in isolation. Some high-payment hospitals may have better clinical outcomes when compared with low-payment hospitals; other high-payment hospitals may not. In an effort to identify practice patterns that may be expensive without conferring a quality benefit, the THA/TKA payment measure specifications are aligned with current quality-of-care measures, such as CMS's 90-day THA/TKA complication measure. In this way, the measure can facilitate the profiling of hospital value and encourage the most efficient delivery of high-quality care. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A payment measure that fairly profiles hospitals by adjusting for hospital case mix and that standardizes payments for geography is congruent with national efforts to increase the transparency of our healthcare system. Although the THA/TKA payment measure is not intended to be used in payment programs, it can provide key insights into those systems of care at hospitals that provide high value as a patient moves from the inpatient to the outpatient setting when interpreted in the context of CMS's THA/TKA complication measure. Because the payment measure spans an episode of care, it is complementary to and may uniquely inform innovative payment models such as bundled payments and Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), both of which seek to improve healthcare value by optimizing the coordination of care across care settings (CMS, 2013).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;THA/TKA provides a suitable environment for optimizing value across an episode of care, as there are many opportunities to improve value for pre-, peri-, and post-operative care. Ultimately, clinical outcomes for THA and TKA depend not just on the surgeon performing the procedure, but on care coordination across provider groups and specialties, as well as the patient's engagement in his or her recovery. The goal of hospital-level resource use measurement is to capture the full spectrum of care in order to incentivize collaboration and shared responsibility for improving patients' health and reducing the burden of their procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are common procedures among elderly patients with substantial range in costs of care likely due to different practice patterns (Sood et al. 2011). A hospital-level, episode-of-care payment measure for THA and TKA is informative for a number of reasons. First, it provides transparency into the differences in costs to Medicare for the same procedures across hospitals. Second, it allows hospitals to assess the payments for patients admitted to their institution relative to other hospitals and thus may incentivize hospitals to examine their own practices and coordinate with post-discharge providers to seek new efficiencies. Finally, when paired with existing outcome measures for THA/TKA patients, it identifies institutions that, after removing the effect of geography, policy adjustments, and case mix, demonstrate good patient outcomes at low cost. Such hospitals may provide important examples of positive deviance from which other hospitals can learn.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quality measures for THA/TKA, such as the 90-day risk-standardized complication rate (RSCR) following THA/TKA, are already publicly reported. In the context of its publicly reported quality measures, THA/TKA is an ideal procedure in which to assess payments for Medicare patients and relative hospital value. Therefore, we created a measure of payments for a 90-day episode of care for THA/TKA that could be aligned with Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services' (CMS's) 90-day THA/TKA complication measure. This will allow CMS to assess the value of care provided for these episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

Refer to Section 2 in the original measure documentation for a summary of the measure methodology and model risk-adjustment variables. Refer to prior methodology and technical reports for further details.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) evaluated and validated the performance of the THA/TKA model using April 2013 to March 2016 data for the 2017 reporting period. They also evaluated the stability of the risk-adjustment model over the three-year measurement period by examining the model variable frequencies, model coefficients, and the performance of the risk-adjustment model in each yea&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CMS assessed generalized linear model performance in terms of discriminant ability for each year of data and for the three-year combined period. Two summary statistics for assessing model performance were computed: the predictive ratio and a quasi-R&amp;sup2;. For a traditional linear model (that is, ordinary least squares regression), R&amp;sup2; is interpreted as the amount of variation in the observed outcome that is explained by the predictor variables (patient-level risk factors). Generalized linear models, however, do not output an R&amp;sup2; that is akin to the R&amp;sup2; of a traditional linear model. A &quot;quasi-R&amp;sup2;&quot; was produced by regressing the total payment outcome on the predicted outcome. Specifically, CMS regressed the total payment on the payment predicted by the patient-level risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The results of these analyses are presented in Section 4.5 of the original measure documentation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THA/TKA Payment 2017 Model Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frequency of THA/TKA Model Variables &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CMS examined the change in the frequencies of clinical and demographic variables. Frequencies of model variables were stable over the measurement period. There were no notable changes (greater than 2% absolute change) in the frequencies. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THA/TKA Model Parameters and Performance &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Table 4.5.2 in the original measure documentation shows the hierarchical generalized linear regression model variable coefficients by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. Table 4.5.3 in the original measure documentation shows the risk-adjusted PRs and 95% confidence intervals for the THA/TKA payment model by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. The quasi-R&amp;sup2; for the THA/TKA payment model was 0.21, suggesting that approximately 21% of the variation in payment can be explained by patient-level risk factors. This quasi-R&amp;sup2; is in line with R&amp;sup2;s from other patient-level risk-adjustment models for healthcare payment (Pope et al., 2011).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the variable effect sizes were relatively constant across years. In addition, model performance was stable over the three-year time period; the quasi-R&amp;sup2; and predictive ratios remained similar to the model used during development.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to the original measure documentation for additional information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

For each patient, risk-adjustment variables are obtained from inpatient, outpatient, and physician Medicare administrative claims data extending 12 months prior to, and including, the index admission. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The measure adjusts for case mix differences among hospitals based on the clinical status of the patient at the time of the index admission. Accordingly, only comorbidities that convey information about the patient at that time or in the 12 months prior, and not complications that arise during the course of the hospitalization, are included in the risk adjustment. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The measure does not adjust for socioeconomic status (SES) because the association between SES and health outcomes can be due, in part, to differences in the quality of healthcare that groups of patients with varying SES receive. The intent is for the measure to adjust for patient demographic and clinical characteristics while illuminating important payment differences. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to Appendix D in the original measure documentation for the list of comorbidity risk-adjustment variables and list of complications that are excluded from risk adjustment if they occur only during the index admission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
