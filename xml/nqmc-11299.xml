      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As readmission following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is likely a signal of perioperative complications and suboptimal transitional care, the readmission measure offers the additional benefit of illuminating areas for improvements for hospitals, in order to minimize medical and surgical complications during surgery and the postoperative period, and improving the care provided in the transition to outpatient settings. The premise is that improved quality of care, including coordination and communication among providers, patients, and their caregivers, can favorably influence performance on these measures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;High readmission rates and wide variation in these rates suggest that there is room for improvement. Reducing readmissions after CABG surgery has been identified as a target for quality measurement. An all-cause readmission measure for patients who undergo CABG surgery will provide hospitals with an incentive to reduce readmissions through prevention and/or early recognition and treatment of postoperative complications, and improved coordination of peri-operative care and discharge planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007, the Medicare Payment Advisory Committee (MedPAC) published a report to Congress in which it identified the seven conditions associated with the most costly potentially preventable readmissions in the United States (U.S.). Among these seven, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) ranked as having the highest potentially preventable readmission rate within 15 days following discharge (13.5%) as well as the second highest average Medicare payment per readmission ($8,136) (MedPAC 2007). The annual cost to Medicare for potentially preventable CABG readmissions was estimated at $151 million.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Variation in readmission rates indicates opportunity for improvement. Applying the measure to 2009 Medicare claims data; the range in hospital-level -standardized readmission rates (RSRRs) is 13.3% to 21.3%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;High readmission rates and wide variation in these rates suggest that there is room for improvement. Reducing readmissions after CABG surgery has been identified as a target for quality measurement. An all-cause readmission measure for patients who undergo CABG surgery will provide hospitals with an incentive to reduce readmissions through prevention and/or early recognition and treatment of postoperative complications, and improved coordination of peri-operative care and discharge planning. Finally, CABG surgery has been identified as a potential applicable condition for use in the Affordable Care Act's Hospital Readmission Reduction Program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

Refer to Section 2 in the original measure documentation for a summary of the measure methodology and model risk-adjustment variables. Refer to prior methodology and technical reports for further details.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) evaluated and validated the performance of the model using July 2013 to June 2016 data for the 2017 reporting period. They also evaluated the stability of the risk-adjustment model over the three-year measurement period by examining the model variable frequencies, model coefficients, and the performance of the risk-adjustment model in each year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CMS assessed logistic regression model performance in terms of discriminant ability for each year of data and for the three-year combined period. They computed two summary statistics to assess model performance: the predictive ability and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (c-statistic). CMS also computed between-hospital variance for each year of data and for the three-year combined period. If there were no systematic differences between hospitals, the between-hospital variance would be zero.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The results of these analyses are presented in Section 4.2 of the original measure documentation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery Readmission 2017 Model Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frequency of CABG Surgery Model Variables&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CMS examined the change in the frequencies of clinical and demographic variables. Frequencies of model variables were stable over measurement period. There were no notable changes (greater than 2% absolute change) in the frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CABG Surgery Model Parameters and Performance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Table 4.2.2 in the original measure documentation shows hierarchical logistic regression model variable coefficients by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. Table 4.2.3 in the original measure documentation shows the risk-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals for the CABG surgery readmission model by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. Overall, the variable effect sizes were relatively constant across years. In addition, model performance was stable over the three-year time period; the c-statistic remained constant at 0.64.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to the original measure documentation for additional information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

The measures assess a dichotomous yes or no outcome of whether each admitted patient has any unplanned readmission within 30 days.

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk-Adjustment Variables&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order to account for differences in case mix among hospitals, the measure adjusts for variables (for example, age, comorbid diseases, and indicators of patient frailty) that are clinically relevant and have relationships with the outcome. For each patient, risk-adjustment variables are obtained from inpatient, outpatient, and physician Medicare administrative claims data extending 12 months prior to, and including, the index admission.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The measure adjusts for case mix differences among hospitals based on the clinical status of the patient at the time of the index admission. Accordingly, only comorbidities that convey information about the patient at that time or in the 12 months prior, and not complications that arise during the course of the hospitalization, are included in the risk adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The measure does not adjust for socioeconomic status (SES) because the association between SES and health outcomes can be due, in part, to differences in the quality of health care that groups of patients with varying SES receive. The intent is for the measure to adjust for patient demographic and clinical characteristics while illuminating important quality differences. As part of the National Quality Forum (NQF) endorsement process for this measure, the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) completed analyses for the two-year Sociodemographic Trial Period. Although univariate analyses found that the patient-level observed (unadjusted) readmission rates are higher for dual-eligible patients (for patients living in lower Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ] SES Index census block groups) and African-American patients compared with all other patients, analyses in the context of a multivariable model demonstrated that the effect size of these variables was small, and that the c-statistics for the models are similar with and without the addition of these variables.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to Appendix D of the original measure documentation for the list of comorbidity risk-adjustment variables and the list of complications that are excluded from risk adjustment if they occur only during the index admission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
