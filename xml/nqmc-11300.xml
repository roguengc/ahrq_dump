      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hospital readmission is an outcome that is influenced by quality of care and is an important outcome for patients. Hospital processes that reflect the quality of inpatient and outpatient care such as discharge planning, medication reconciliation, and coordination of outpatient care have been shown to reduce readmission rates (Nelson, Maruish, &amp;amp; Axler, 2000). Although readmission rates are also influenced by hospital system characteristics, such as the bed capacity of the local health care system (Fisher et al., 1994), these hospital characteristics should not influence quality of care. Therefore, this measure does not risk adjust for such hospital characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Measuring and reporting elective primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) and/or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) readmission rates will inform health care providers about opportunities to improve care, strengthen incentives for quality improvement, and promote improvements in the quality of care received by Medicare patients and the outcomes they experience. The measure will also provide patients with information that could guide their choices regarding where they seek care for these elective procedures. Furthermore, the measure will increase transparency for consumers and has the potential to lower health care costs by reducing the risk of readmissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010 there were 168,000 total hip arthroplasties (THAs) and 385,000 total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) performed on Medicare beneficiaries 65 years and older (National Center for Health Statistics [NCHS], 2010). Although these procedures dramatically improve quality of life, they are costly. In 2005, annual hospital charges totaled $3.95 billion and $7.42 billion for primary THA and TKA, respectively (Kurtz et al., 2007). These costs are projected to increase by 340% to 17.4 billion for THA and by 450% to 40.8 billion for TKA by 2015 (Kurtz et al., 2007). Medicare is the single largest payer for these procedures, covering approximately two-thirds of all THAs and TKAs performed in the US (Ong et al., 2006). Combined, THA and TKA procedures account for the largest procedural cost in the Medicare budget (Bozic et al., 2008). &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Measuring and reporting elective primary THA/TKA readmission rates will inform health care providers about opportunities to improve care, strengthen incentives for quality improvement, and promote improvements in the quality of care received by Medicare patients and the outcomes they experience. The measure will also provide patients with information that could guide their choices regarding where they seek care for these elective procedures. Furthermore, the measure will increase transparency for consumers and has the potential to lower health care costs by reducing the risk of readmissions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The THA/TKA hospital-specific risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) measure is thus intended to inform quality-of-care improvement efforts, as individual process-based performance measures cannot encompass all the complex and critical aspects of care within a hospital that contribute to patient outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

Refer to Section 2 in the original measure documentation for a summary of the measure methodology and model risk-adjustment variables. Refer to prior methodology and technical reports for further details.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) evaluated and validated the performance of the models using July 2013 to June 2016 data for the 2017 reporting period. They also evaluated the stability of the risk-adjustment model over the three-year measurement period by examining the model variable frequencies, model coefficients, and the performance of the risk-adjustment model in each year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CMS assessed logistic regression model performance in terms of discriminant ability for each year of data and for the three-year combined period. They computed two summary statistics to assess model performance: the predictive ability and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (c-statistic). CMS also computed between-hospital variance for each year of data and for the three-year combined period. If there were no systematic differences between hospitals, the between-hospital variance would be zero.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The results of these analyses are presented in Section 4.3 of the original measure documentation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THA/TKA Readmission 2017 Model Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frequency of Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) and/or Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) Model Variables&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CMS examined the change in the frequencies of clinical and demographic variables. Frequencies of model variables were stable over the measurement period. There were no large changes (greater than 2% absolute change) in the frequencies. However, the increases in frequencies of Morbid obesity and Renal failure observed in 2016 public reporting continue, but only by 0.8% and 1.1%, respectively, over the three-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THA/TKA Model Parameters and Performance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Table 4.3.2 in the original measure documentation shows hierarchical logistic regression model variable coefficients by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. Table 4.3.3 in the original measure documentation shows the risk-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals for the THA/TKA readmission model by individual year and for the combined three-year dataset. Overall, the variable effect sizes were relatively constant across years. In addition, model performance was stable over the three-year time period; the c-statistic remained constant at 0.66.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to the original measure documentation for additional information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

The measures assess a dichotomous yes or no outcome of whether each admitted patient has any unplanned readmission within 30 days. If the first readmission after discharge is planned, any subsequent unplanned readmission is not considered in the outcome for that index admission because the unplanned readmission could be related to care provided during the intervening planned readmission rather than during the index admission.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The hospital-specific risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) is calculated as the ratio of the number of &quot;predicted&quot; readmissions to the number of &quot;expected&quot; readmissions, multiplied by the national unadjusted readmission rate. The &quot;numerator&quot; of the ratio is the number of readmissions within 30 days predicted on the basis of the hospital's performance with its observed case-mix.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p class=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: This outcome measure does not have a traditional numerator and denominator like a core process measure; thus, this field is used to define the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p class=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;See the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qualitynet.org/dcs/ContentServer?c=Page&amp;amp;pagename=QnetPublic%2FPage%2FQnetTier4&amp;amp;cid=1219069855841&quot; title=&quot;QualityNet Web site&quot;&gt;2017 Procedure-specific Measures Updates and Specifications Report: Hospital-level 30-day Risk-standardized Readmission Measures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Admissions identified as planned by the planned readmissions algorithm are not counted as readmissions. The planned readmission algorithm is a set of criteria for classifying readmissions as planned among the general Medicare population using Medicare administrative claims data. The algorithm identifies admissions that are typically planned and may occur within 30 days of discharge from the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The planned readmission algorithm has three fundamental principles:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;A few specific, limited types of care are always considered planned (transplant surgery, maintenance chemotherapy/immunotherapy, rehabilitation); &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Otherwise, a planned readmission is defined as a non-acute readmission for a scheduled procedure; and, &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Admissions for acute illness or for complications of care are never planned. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The planned readmission algorithm uses a flow chart and four tables of procedures and conditions to operationalize these principles and to classify readmissions as planned. The flow chart and tables are available in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qualitynet.org/dcs/ContentServer?c=Page&amp;amp;pagename=QnetPublic%2FPage%2FQnetTier4&amp;amp;cid=1219069855841&quot; title=&quot;QualityNet Web site&quot;&gt;2017 Procedure-specific Measures Updates and Specifications Report: Hospital-level 30-day Risk-standardized Readmission Measures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

For each patient, risk-adjustment variables are obtained from inpatient, outpatient, and physician Medicare administrative claims data extending 12 months prior to, and including, the index admission.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The measure adjusts for case mix differences among hospitals based on the clinical status of the patient at the time of the index admission. Accordingly, only comorbidities that convey information about the patient at that time or in the 12 months prior, and not complications that arise during the course of the hospitalization, are included in the risk adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The measure does not adjust for socioeconomic status (SES) because the association between SES and health outcomes can be due, in part, to differences in the quality of health care that groups of patients with varying SES receive. The intent is for the measure to adjust for patient demographic and clinical characteristics while illuminating important quality differences. As part of the National Quality Forum (NQF) endorsement process for this measures, the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) completed analyses for the two-year Sociodemographic Trial Period. Although univariate analyses found that the patient-level observed (unadjusted) readmission rates are higher for dual-eligible patients (for patients living in lower Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ] SES Index census block groups) and African-American patients compared with all other patients, analyses in the context of a multivariable model demonstrated that the effect size of these variables was small, and that the c-statistics for the models are similar with and without the addition of these variables.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to Appendix D of the original measure documentation for the list of comorbidity risk-adjustment variables and the list of complications that are excluded from risk adjustment if they occur only during the index admission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
