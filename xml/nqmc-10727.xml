      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (1997), pneumococcal disease kills more people in the United States each year than all other vaccine-preventable diseases combined. Older people and persons with chronic health conditions are at high risk for pneumococcal disease. However, estimated pneumococcal vaccination coverage remains below 50% in recommended high risk groups (National Health Interview Survey, 2006). Vaccinations of nursing facility residents can prevent or lower the risk of residents becoming seriously ill. Healthy People 2010 includes Objective 14-29f, for institutionalized adults, of a 90% vaccination rate in 2010 (Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion [ODPHP], 2000).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hospitalization rates for pneumonia-related stays for the elderly population have been increasing over the past 15 years, and among those 85 and older, at least 1 in 20 elderly persons were hospitalized each year because of pneumonia (Fry et al., 2005). In 2005, Medicare paid an average of $6,342 per hospital discharge for pneumonia-related short-stay hospitalizations; the average length of stay was 6.1 days. The number of Medicare reimbursed discharges for the same year was 670,000 (Health Care Financing Review, 2007). &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In an analysis of quality measures using MDS data from the first quarter (Q1) of 2006 for a random 10% facility sample, the University of Colorado found that this measure had a significant amount of variability across facilities. The quality measure varied from 10.7% at the 10th percentile to 100% at the 90th percentile. In addition, 13.8% of facilities had 100% vaccination (Brega et al., 2008).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This measure is intended to encourage nursing facilities to focus on this important aspect of clinical care by assessing residents on the status of their pneumococcal vaccine immunization and to provide immunization as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;In 2004, the seventh most common cause of death for persons aged 65 and older in the United States was pneumonia and influenza (Gorina et al., 2008). Death related to pneumonia affects the elderly at a higher rate, especially for those aged 85 and older (Thompson et al., 2003). Almost 60,000 deaths in 2004 were caused by influenza and pneumonia, and more than 85% of those were for the elderly (Gorina et al., 2008). Frail elderly are especially at risk for contracting pneumonia as a complication of another infection or medical condition. In the same year, there were approximately 123,000 deaths with influenza and pneumonia mentioned on the death certificate as a secondary cause of death (Gorina et al., 2008). &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Racial segregation between nursing homes has been shown to be a major factor in racial disparities in the nursing home population, primarily for blacks. In 2000, a study drawing on national Minimum Data Set (MDS) and Online Survey, Certification, and Reporting (OSCAR) data found that two-thirds of all black residents were living in just 10% of all facilities (Smith et al., 2007). A 2002 survey of a stratified sample of 39 nursing homes and 181 residential care/assisted-living facilities in four states had similar findings (Howard et al., 2002). Facilities serving blacks have demonstrated a lower level of quality care than those serving whites with lower staff-to-resident ratios and higher deficiency ratings (Grabowski, 2004). Minority groups, in general, and blacks, in particular, have also had more limited access to nursing home care than whites (National Center for Health Statistics [NCHS], Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 1997).&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;Pneumococcal vaccination rates are lower for black nursing home residents than for white residents&amp;mdash;31% of black residents compared with 24% of white residents aged 65 years or older had never received a pneumococcal vaccination. Blacks also had higher odds of unknown vaccination status than whites in Medicaid-only facilities and lower odds of unknown status in government owned facilities. The racial difference in pneumococcal vaccination exists predominantly in certain facility types (Marsteller et al., 2008). &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A joint RAND/Harvard team engaged in a deliberate iterative process to incorporate provider and consumer input, expert consultation, scientific advances in clinical knowledge about screening and assessment, Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) experience, and intensive item development and testing by a national Veteran's Health Administration (VHA) consortium. This process allowed the final national testing of Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 to include well-developed and tested items.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The national validation and evaluation of the MDS 3.0 included 71 community nursing homes (NHs) (3,822 residents) and 19 VHA NHs (764 residents), regionally distributed throughout the United States. The evaluation was designed to test and analyze inter-rater agreement (reliability) between gold-standard (research) nurses and between facility and gold-standard nurses, validity of key sections, response rates for interview items, anonymous feedback on changes from participating nurses, and time to complete the MDS assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the test results showed that MDS 3.0 items had either excellent or very good reliability even when comparing research nurse to facility-nurse assessment. In most instances these were higher than those seen in the past with MDS 2.0. In addition, for the cognitive, mood and behavior items, national testing included collection of independent criterion or gold-standard measures. These MDS 3.0 sections were more highly matched to criterion measures than were MDS 2.0 items.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Improvements incorporated in MDS 3.0 produced a more efficient assessment: better quality information was obtained in less time. Such gains should improve identification of resident needs and enhance resident-focused care planning. In addition, including items recognized in other care settings is likely to enhance communication among providers. These significant gains reflect the cumulative effect of changes across the tool, including use of more valid items, direct inclusion of resident reports, improved clarity of retained items, deletion of poorly performing items, form redesign, and briefer assessment periods for clinical items.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to &lt;em&gt;Development &amp;amp; Validation of a Revised Nursing Home Assessment Tool: MDS 3.0.&lt;/em&gt; for additional information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
