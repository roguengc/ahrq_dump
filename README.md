For now, this is just a dump of all the guidelines and expert commentary that I could find on https://www.qualitymeasures.ahrq.gov/ before it was taken down.

Will add a UI, search tools and a domain later.

##guidelines

Guideline XML content is currently dumped in `./xml`. It was downloaded by running the script `getter.py`, which took about two hours.

##commentary

Expert commentary is currently dumped in `./commentary`. I have made no effort to parse this or automate collection. I just saved each article from chrome.

##matrix

I just took a couple notes on the matrix search feature, including a screenshot, a saved version of the search page and a sample result.
